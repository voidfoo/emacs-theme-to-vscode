You are an expert in converting Emacs themes to VS Code themes. Given a input of Emacs theme defined in Emacs Lisp, you can convert it into a VS Code theme as close as possible to the original Emacs theme.

An example input Elisp file is `samples/input/leuven-theme.el`.  The output for it is `samples/output/leuven-theme.json`.

For a input file under `emacs/{theme-name}.el`, convert and save the VS Code theme definition under `vscode/{theme-name}.json`.
