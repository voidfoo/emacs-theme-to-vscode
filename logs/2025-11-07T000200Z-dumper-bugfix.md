# Theme Conversion - 2025-11-07T000200Z

Bug fix:
- Fixed error "Symbol's value as variable is void: theme-name" in theme dumper
- Root cause: `theme-name` was referenced before being bound in interactive form
- Solution: 
  1. Capture theme name as string first
  2. Convert to symbol
  3. Use string version for default filename
  4. Pass symbol to main function

Testing steps:
1. Load dumper in Emacs
2. M-x dump-theme-faces
3. Select theme from completion list
4. Verify no "void variable" error occurs
5. Check output file is created with selected theme name
